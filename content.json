The easiest way to generate this final output is to use ShareLaTeX, ShareLaTeX has a ready-to-use LaTeX distribution and final documents can be generated by simply clicking the “Recompile” button; if this is your case you can skip this article. Otherwise, if you need to learn how to compile documents in your computer, this article describes how to generate PS, DVI and PDF output from a LaTeX file. IntroductionLaTeX documents are plain documents with a .tex extension (see the Creating a document in LaTeX article for examples), this plain text file has some markup commands that are meant to format the document but, how do you actually generate the final output?. It depends on the type of document you want to generate. Suppose you saved your document and named the file “mydocument.tex”. To create a .PDF file just run this command in the system terminal.1pdflatex mydocument.tex And a file named “mydocument.pdf” will appear. TeX distributionsThe set of programs that make possible to compile TeX and LaTeX documents is called a TeX typesetting or a TeX distribution. There are many TeX distributions available for different operating systems: MiKTeX for Windows TeX Live for Linux and other UNIX-like systems MacTeX redistribution of TeX Live for Mac OS X teTeX for Linux and other UNIX-like systems, now is no longer actively maintained proTeXt is based on MiKTeX Of course, if you don’t want to go through the process of installing a TeX distribution, you can use an on-line ready to use option like ShareLaTeX. LaTeX editorsThere are many advanced text editors specifically dedicated to LaTeX for the most popular operating systems, some of them can be downloaded for free while others are proprietary software: Open source: AUCTEX, GNU TeXmacs, Gummi, Kile, LaTeXila, MeWa, TeXShop, TeXnicCenter, Texmaker, TeXstudio, TeXworks Freeware: LEd, WinShell Proprietary/Shareware: Inlage, Scientific WorkPlace, WinEdt There are also general-purpose editors that add LaTeX-friendly options by means of plugins. For example the well known editors emacs and vim (also sublime text, atom) have both a LaTeX extension. It’s worth to mention that the editor in ShareLaTeX can be customized to emulate the emacs or vim behaviour. It is also themeable, so you can choose the same syntax highlighting of some of the aforementioned editors. Output formatsThere are three output formats available in all TeX distributions. To generate a specific output the document has to be compiled by running a command in a terminal (linux and osx) or the command prompt (windows). For example, if you want to compile a file named “mydocument.tex” you can use one of the next commands:1latex mydocument.tex This will create “mydocument.dvi”, a DVI document.1pdflatex mydocument.tex This will generate “mydocument.pdf”, a PDF document. There are some additional commands that allow conversion between formats, PS images are also supported. See the reference guide for a schematic description of commands and output formats. A description of each output format is provided below: (DVI) Device independent file format consists of binary data describing the visual layout of a document in a manner not reliant on any specific image format, display hardware or printer. (PS) PostScript file format describes text and graphics on page and it is based on vector graphics. PostScript is, until now, a standard in desktop publishing areas. (PDF) Portable Document Format is a file format, based on PostScript, used to represent documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. It is now widely used as a file format for printing and for distribution on the Web. Note: Most of the editors nowadays include quick-access icons to compile to different output formats so you don’t have to actually run the commands in a system prompt. Compiling documents with cross-referencesIn some cases, when your document includes cross-references, you must compile the source twice. It is necessary to include the correct numbers in the table of contents, list of images, reference numbers to theorems and so on. During the first compilation the LaTeX compiler writes the .aux file for informations about different numbering and during the second one the compiler reads these informations in order to properly generate a table of contents, bibliography, etc. This process can be automatized by the command latexmk. For example, to create a pdf out of the “mydocument.tex” file, run1latexmk -pdf mydocument.tex only once, even if the document has referenced images and bibliography. You can change -pdf to -dvi to set a different file type.

It’s based on the ‘WYSIWYM’ (what you see is what you mean) idea, meaning you only have to focus on the contents of your document and the computer will take care of the formatting. With LaTeX, it’s very easy to create professional-looking material. This article presents the basics of how to create a document. IntroductionLet’s start with the simplest working example:123456\\documentclass&#123;article&#125; \\begin&#123;document&#125;First document. This is a simple example, with no extra parameters or packages included.\\end&#123;document&#125; The input file is just a plain text file, with the extension .tex. It will contain code that the computer interprets to produce a PDF file. The first line of code declares the type of document, in this case is an article. Then, between the \\begin{document} \\end{document} tags you must write the text of your document. Note: To learn how to generate the output file see the Compile article. The preamble of a documentIn the previous example the text was entered after the \\begin{document} command. The part of your .tex file before this point is called the preamble. In the preamble, you define the type of document you are writing and the language, load extra packages you will need, and set several parameters. For instance, a normal document preamble would look like this:123456\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]&#123;article&#125;\\usepackage[utf8]&#123;inputenc&#125; \\title&#123;First document&#125;\\author&#123;Hubert Farnsworth \\thanks&#123;funded by the ShareLaTeX team&#125;&#125;\\date&#123;February 2014&#125; Below a detailed description of each line:1\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]&#123;article&#125; As said before, this defines the type of document. Some additional parameters inside brackets and comma-separated can be passed to the command. In the example, the extra parameters set the font size (12pt) and the paper size (letterpaper). Of course other font sizes (9pt, 11pt, 12pt) can be used, the default size is 10pt. As for the paper size, other possible values are included A4 and legalpaper. Note that ShareLaTeX uses a European LaTeX distribution, which produces documents in A4 size by default. See our Page size and margins article for for information about using the Geometry package to set further formatting parameters.1\\usepackage[utf8]&#123;inputenc&#125; This is the encoding for the document, to allow characters beyond ASCII (e.g. à, ü, č …) to be used in the text. It can be omitted or changed to another encoding but utf-8 is recommended. Unless you specifically need another encoding, or if you are unsure about it, add this line to the preamble. The next three lines are self-descriptive. Anyway, you can see a description of what they actually do in the next section. Another important parameter that can be passed to the \\documentclass command is twocolumn if you want your text in a two-column format and twoside for two-side paper sheet printing. Displaying the title of your documentTo display the title of your document you have to declare its components in the preamble and then use some additional code:123456789101112131415161718\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper, twoside]&#123;article&#125;\\usepackage[utf8]&#123;inputenc&#125; \\title&#123;First document&#125;\\author&#123;Hubert Farnsworth \\thanks&#123;funded by the ShareLaTeX team&#125;&#125;\\date&#123;February 2014&#125; \\begin&#123;document&#125; \\begin&#123;titlepage&#125;\\maketitle\\end&#123;titlepage&#125; In this document some extra packages and parameterswere added. There is an encoding packageand pagesize and fontsize parameters. \\end&#123;document&#125; There is a block with three lines in the preamble that defines the information to be included on the title page.1\\title&#123;First document&#125; This is the title.1\\author&#123;Hubert Farnsworth&#125; Here you put the name(s) of the author(s) and, as an optional parameter, you can add the next command:1\\thanks&#123;funded by the ShareLaTeX team&#125; This can be added after the name of the author, inside the braces of the title command. It will add a superscript and a footnote with the text inside the braces. Useful if you need to thank an institution in your article.1\\date&#123;February 2014&#125; You can enter the date manually or use the command \\today so the date will be updated automatically at the time you compile your document. Once you have that in the preamble now in the body of your document you can use the next commands for the information to be printed.1\\begin&#123;titlepage&#125; \\end&#123;titlepage&#125; This declares an environment, a block of code with a specific behaviour depending on its type. In this case whatever you include in this titlepage environment will appear in the first page of your document.1\\maketitle This command will print the title, the author and the date in the format shown in the example. If it’s not enclosed in a titlepage environment, it will be shown at the beginning of the document, above the first line. Basic formatting: abstract, paragraphs and newlinesEverything included inside the \\begin{document} \\end{document} commands will be rendered in the final document. 1234567891011121314151617\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper, twoside]&#123;article&#125;\\usepackage[utf8]&#123;inputenc&#125; \\begin&#123;document&#125; \\begin&#123;abstract&#125;This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the document. A brief introduction to the main subject.\\end&#123;abstract&#125; In this document some extra packages and parameterswere added. There is an encoding package,and pagesize and fontsize parameters. This line will start a second paragraph. And I can brake\\\\ the lines \\\\ and continue on a new line. \\end&#123;document&#125; In scientific documents, it’s a common practice to include a brief overview of the main subject of the paper. In LATEX, the abstract environment is for this purpose. The abstract environment will put the text in a special format at the top of your document. When writing the contents of your document, if you need to start a new paragraph you must hit the “Enter” key twice (to insert a double blank line). Notice that paragraphs have a white space before the first line. To start a new line without actually starting a new paragraph insert a break line point, this can be done by \\ (a double backslash as in the example) or the \\newline command. You can find more information in the Paragraphs and new lines article. For a more complete discussion about document structuring see the article about sections and chapters. CommentsSometimes it’s necessary to add comments to your LaTeX code for readability. This is straightforward, put a % before the comment and LaTeX will ignore that text.123456789101112131415161718192021\\documentclass&#123;article&#125;\\usepackage[utf8]&#123;inputenc&#125; %codification of the document \\usepackage&#123;comment&#125; %Here begins the body of the document\\begin&#123;document&#125;This document contains a lot of comments, none of themwill appear here, only this text. This document contains a lot of comments, none of themwill appear here, only this text. \\begin&#123;comment&#125;This text won&apos;t show up in the compiled pdfthis is just a multi-line comment. Usefulto, for instance, comment out slow-rendering partswhile working on a draft.\\end&#123;comment&#125; \\end&#123;document&#125; In the last part of the example, you can see a comment environment. This helps in multi-line comments instead of putting a % at the beginning of each line. For this to work you must add the next line to your preamble:1\\usepackage&#123;comment&#125; The % symbols is a reserved character, if you actually need this symbol to be printed in your document, use \\%. See the reference guide for a full list of reserved characters. Reference guideDocument types available in the \\documentclass command.

See the beamer documentation for a better description.
